I used to be a brat when I discover some cool skills on the Internet, which leads to a big problem that keep me away from a real hacker. An unsystematic way to obtain the methods to approach something will keep you have lots of ideas about how to realize them, but can not understand them deeply in a system level, as well as solve problems with a global perspective. On the other hand, JavaScript's learning really needs a systematic thinking about how to solve problems, so I sucks really a lot before supervisor gave me some problems.

The most important four elements in understanding JavaScript are:

 - Callback Function
 - Scoping
 - Anonymous functions
 - Object
 
There's really a lot of resource when you Google how to understand them, so I do not repeat them here. Then follows two links about how to learn them well in a better way, the first website is **[JavaScript: The Right Way][1]**. The content covers a guide intended to introduce new developers to JavaScript and help experienced developers learn more about its best practices, such as JavaScript Code Style, design patterns contained in JavaScript, some frameworks, game engines, etc. The website may not explain the points that mentioned in it specifically, but it really gives people a good direction in how to understand and learn JavaScript deeply.

The second link I want to share is **[Principles of Writing Consistent, Idiomatic JavaScript][2]**. It is a doc about how to write consistent, idiomatic JavaScript in our daily life. It provides many tralated versions for different kinds of people around the world.

Last but not the least, my supervisor told me that practice is the only way to approach our aim. So, get on your editor (WebStorm, Sublime Text), pick up a JS library (three.js or D3.js) and start your cool coding!
